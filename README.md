## 💡 Overview  

**Principle** is a powerful prototyping and animation tool designed for creating interactive user interfaces and motion-rich experiences. Built exclusively for macOS, it empowers UI and UX designers to transform static visuals into functional, engaging prototypes that look and feel real.  

The software bridges the gap between design and interaction, allowing you to visualize transitions, gestures, and animations without any coding. You can easily animate multiple artboards, simulate screen flows, and preview everything instantly within the app.  

With its intuitive **timeline editor**, Principle offers precise control over animation sequences, easing effects, and object hierarchy. It’s perfectly suited for micro-interactions, onboarding flows, and complete app prototypes. The integration with **Figma** and **Sketch** ensures a seamless workflow, allowing quick import of existing designs for further enhancement.  

Principle’s performance is optimized for Apple hardware, ensuring smooth playback and accurate rendering even in complex projects. You can preview your work on your Mac or mirror it on iPhone and iPad to test animations in real-world conditions.  

Whether you're designing next-generation app interfaces or showcasing interactive motion concepts, **Principle** provides a fluid, visual environment where ideas come to life through movement, precision, and creativity.
